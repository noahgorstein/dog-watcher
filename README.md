### Build from source

## Usage

Run the app by running `dog-watcher` in a terminal. See `dog-watcher --help` and [configuration](#configuration) section below for details.

| `esc` | clear filter |
| `ctrl+x` | kill highlighted process |

## Configuration

`dog-watcher` can be configured in a yaml file at `$HOME/.dog-watcher.yaml`.

Example yaml file:

```yaml
# .dog-watcher.yaml
username: "admin"
password: "admin"
server: "http://localhost:5820"
```

Alternatively, `dog-watcher` can be configured via environment variables, or via command line args visible by running `dog-watcher --help`.

> Command line args take precedence over both the configuation file and environment variables. Environment variables take precedence over the configuration file.

`dog-watcher` will attempt to authenticate using the default superuser `admin` with password `admin` on `http://localhost:5820` if no credentials are provided.
